<p> The Poison type is regarded as one of the weakest offensively. 
    Prior to Pok√©mon X/Y it was super-effective only against Grass (many of which are dual Poison so neutralizes the effect). 
    It now has an extra advantage against the new Fairy type. 
    In the first generation it was also super-effective against Bug but this was changed. 
    It fares a little better defensively but its best advantage is through status moves like Toxic.
