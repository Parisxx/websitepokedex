<p> The Psychic type has few outright strengths, however, it also has
     few weaknesses. In the first generation it ended up being massively overpowered, mainly due to a complete lack 
     of powerful Bug moves, its only weakness. Furthermore, a mistake in the game meant that Ghost-type moves had no effect 
     on Psychic (although this only affected the low-powered Lick). Generation
     2 rectified the situation with the addition of the Dark type along with better Pok√©mon and moves of all types.
